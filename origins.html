                        <p class="text">In 1972, Brian Kernighan wrote an internal Bell Labs memo titled "A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B." In it, he presented what may be the first known example of a program that simply printed a greeting to the world. The code was humble, almost mundane—yet it would become one of the most replicated snippets in computing history.</p>
                        <p class="text">The exact phrase "hello, world" (lowercase, with a comma) appeared in this tutorial as the canonical example of a minimal, working program. It served a simple pedagogical purpose: demonstrate that the language works, that output is possible, and that you—yes, you—can make the computer speak.</p>

This wasn't just any programming book—it became the definitive reference for C, selling millions of copies and teaching generations of programmers.</p>
                        <p class="text">The book's first example program was, naturally, Hello World. But there was a subtle change: the 'H' was now capitalized, and the punctuation varied in different editions. The 1978 first edition showed:</p>

                        <p class="text">From C, the tradition spread like wildfire. Every new programming language tutorial, every textbook, every online course seemed to begin the same way. Even languages that predated K&R's book retroactively adopted Hello World as their canonical first program.</p>
                        <p class="text">By the 1980s and 1990s, "Hello, World!" had transcended C. It appeared in:</p>

                            <li><strong>Pascal</strong> textbooks teaching structured programming</li>
                            <li><strong>BASIC</strong> manuals for home computer enthusiasts</li>
                            <li><strong>Java</strong> courses at universities worldwide</li>

                        <p class="text">Today, you can find Hello World implementations in hundreds of languages—from mainstream ones like Python and JavaScript to esoteric languages like Brainfuck and Shakespeare. Each one is a small tribute to Kernighan's original example.</p>

                            <li>Computing factorial of a number</li>

                        <p class="text">These were pedagogically sound but lacked personality. They treated the computer as a calculating machine rather than a communication device. "Hello, World!" changed that—it acknowledged that programming is about communication, about making machines speak in human language.</p>

                                <p class="bio-title">Computer Scientist, Bell Labs & Princeton University</p>
                                <p class="bio-text">Born in 1942 in Toronto, Canada, Brian Kernighan is a legendary computer scientist whose influence on programming is immeasurable. At Bell Labs, he worked alongside Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson during the creation of Unix. Beyond co-authoring <em>The C Programming Language</em>, he contributed to AWK (the 'K' stands for Kernighan), and wrote numerous influential books on programming.</p>
                                <p class="bio-text">Kernighan has said in interviews that he doesn't remember the exact origin of "hello, world"—it was simply a natural, friendly example. He may not have realized that these two words would echo through computer science education for over half a century, typed by millions of aspiring programmers taking their first steps into code.</p>
                                <p class="bio-text">Now a professor emeritus at Princeton University, Kernighan continues to teach and write about computing, programming languages, and the craft of software development.</p>
