## 🤝 Contributing

We'd love your help expanding this collection! Here's how to contribute:

### Adding a New Language

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `languages.js`
3. Add your language following this structure:

```javascript
{
    name: "YourLanguage",
    year: 2024,
    tags: ["compiled", "oop"], // Choose from: compiled, interpreted, functional, oop, esoteric, web, system
    code: `your code here`,
